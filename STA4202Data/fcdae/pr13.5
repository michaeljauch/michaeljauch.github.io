# Data originally from Whiting, Kelly Reid (1990) "Host-Specific
# Pathogens and the Corn/Soybean Rotation Effect", Ph. D. Dissertation,
# University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN.
#
# The response of interest is the weight (g) of 100 random seeds from
# soybean plants.  The plants are of two varieties (Hodgson 78 and
# BSR191).  We observe data from the fifth year of four different
# crop rotation patterns (soybeans after 4 years of corn, second
# year of soybeans after 3 years of corn, final soybean in an
# S-C-S-C-S pattern, and 5 consequtive years of soybeans).
# This experiment was conducted twice in Waseca and twice in 
# Lamberton, with 1987 and 1988 being the fifth years of the
# two replicates (ie, the sequences were offset one year).
# Column 1 is the response.  Column 2 indicates year/location
# (1=W87, 2=W88, 3=L87, 4=L88).  Column 3 indicates rotation treatment
# (1-4 in the order given above).  Column 4 indicates variety
# (1=HOD, 2=BSR).
