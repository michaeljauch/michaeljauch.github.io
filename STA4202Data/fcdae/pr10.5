# Data originally from Table 17 of M. Sutheerawattananonda (1994)
# "Variation in Physical Properties and Microstructure of
# Extruded Wheat Flours", MS Thesis, University of Minnesota.
#
# These data are the size of the air cells in the "expanded
# extrudates" of flours.  Column 1 is size in mm^2.  Column 2
# is the variety of wheat (cultivar) used to make the flour.
# Column 3 is the location where the wheat was grown.  Column 4
# is the temperature at which the extrusion was performed
# 1=120C, 2=180C.
