# Data originally from Table 1 of Bruce Welch (1996) "Effects of Humidity
# on Storing Big Sagebrush Seed", USDA Forest Service, Intermountain
# Research Station, Research Paper INT-RP-493.
#
# Sixty-three batches of 300 seeds (big sagebrush, Hobble Creek var.)
# are divided into 21 groups of three.  These batches are subjected
# to storage for either 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360 days at
# 0, 32, or 45 percent relative humidity.  After storage, the seeds
# are planted.  The response is the percent viable seeds.  Column
# 1 is storage, column 2 is humidity, and column 3 is percent
# viability.
