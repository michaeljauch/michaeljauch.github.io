# A data set from Oehlert (2000) \emph{A First Course in Design and
# Analysis of Experiments}, New York: W. H. Freeman.
#
# Data originally from Atsushi Tajima (1987) "Some Aspects of Preserving
# Chicken Semen: Glycerol Effect, Assay Method, and Application"
# Ph. D. Dissertation, Univ. of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN.
#
# Four semen mixtures are prepared, consisting of either
# fresh or frozen Rhode Island Red semen, and either fresh or
# frozen White Leghorn semen.  Batches of Rhode Island Red hens
# are inseminated and the response measured is the fraction of
# the hatching eggs that have white feathers (ie, have the dominant
# White Leghorn gene from the semen).  There are 4 replicates.
# The data have three columns: response, rir, and wl.  The
# response in column 1 is the fraction of hatching eggs with
# white feathers.  Column 2 is 1 for fresh RIR semen and 2 for
# frozen RIR.  Column 3 is 1 for fresh WL semen, and 2 for frozen
# WL semen.
