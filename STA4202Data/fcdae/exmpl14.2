# Test of 9 different detergents.  There are three basins that are
# used simultaneously at the same rate with a different detergent in each
# basin.  Response is number of plates until foam disappears in a basin.  
# Column 1 is session. Column 2 is treatment (kind of detergen).  Column
# 3 is response (number of dishes). Treatments 1-4 are detergent base 1
# with (3, 2, 1, or 0) parts additive.  Treatments 5-8 are detergent base
# 2 with (3, 2, 1, or 0) parts additive.  Treatment 9 is a control.
