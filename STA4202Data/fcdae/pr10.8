# and of Duration of Fast upon Plasma Levels of Free Leucine, Iosleucine,
# and Valine in the Growing Pig," Ph. D. thesis, University of Minnesota.
# 
# These data give the concentration of plasma free leucine
# in mcg/ml 8 hours post feeding for several pigs.  The
# treatments are different protein sources and percents
# of protein in the meal.  Sources 1, 2, 3 are fish meal,
# soybean meal, and dried skim milk.  Protein percent
# levels 1, 2, 3, 4 are 9, 12, 15, and 18 percent protein.
# Columns are source, percent, and response.
