	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>I'm a PhD candidate in Statistical Science at Duke University advised by Peter Hoff and David Dunson. Very broadly, I'm interested in methodology for multivariate data. My dissertation research addresses challenges which arise in Bayesian analyses of statistical models with orthogonal matrix parameters, including computation and prior specification. </p>
	<p>I can be reached by email at michael.jauch@duke.edu</p>
